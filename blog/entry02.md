## Content: Learning My Tool & Making My Freedom Project Goal For The Winter Break

From November 10 to December 15, I have been learning my tool **Flutter**. I used [this YouTube Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9giLVXCHSQmWqlHc9BLXdVx&si=ukFdAKzmSUXAv6PO). While watching the tutorials, I took notes and tinkered in my IDE.

## Sources

My first resource is from my IDE/Github, where I stored & tinkered with my tool (tool folder): [Link To My Tool Folder](https://github.com/nancyc0337/apcsa-freedom-project/tree/main/tool).

My second resource is from my IDE/Github, where I wrote down my progress of what I did with my tool: [Link To My Learning Log](https://github.com/nancyc0337/apcsa-freedom-project/blob/main/tool/learning-log.md).

My third resource is a website about Flutter: [Link To flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/).

My fourth resource is a Flutter Tutorials playlist from Youtube that I found: [Link To The Flutter Crash Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9giLVXCHSQmWqlHc9BLXdVx&si=ukFdAKzmSUXAv6PO).

## Engineering Design Process

Right now in the Engineering Design Process(EDP), I am on the 5th step(Create a prototype). Currently, we are using many resources to learn our tool to make our project. I think I'll be on 6th step(Test and evaluate the prototype), using what we learned about our tool to create our game.

## Skills

1)

2)

## Summary
In conclusion, for the winter break (December 24 - January 4), my Freedom Project goal is to continue watching the [YouTube Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9giLVXCHSQmWqlHc9BLXdVx&si=ukFdAKzmSUXAv6PO). After finishing the [YouTube Tutorial](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9giLVXCHSQmWqlHc9BLXdVx&si=ukFdAKzmSUXAv6PO), I'll use what I learned about **Flutter** to make my CheerCharm app to help people to be less depressed!
