# Plan

## Tool: Flutter

## Product: Multifunctional App (Name: CheerCharm)

It will have 2-3 functions.

First function is it can give the user motivation quotes/advice.

Second function is the user can make a "to do list" for organization.

Third function (beyond MVP) is if bored, the user can play some games in the "games" section.

The purpose is to make a project to make people less depressed!
